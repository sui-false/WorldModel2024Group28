There is one div with the id \"query-color\" and a pink background, and another with class \"color\" and data-color=\"pink\". Both are potential targets. There are no SVG elements present in the HTML. The problem is a simple element selection task.  To achieve the goal, I will click on the div with id \"query-color\" because it is explicitly mentioned in the goal's description.
